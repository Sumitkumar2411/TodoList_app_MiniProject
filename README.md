## 🎯 What I Learned
While creating this project, I explored and strengthened several core concepts:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting, creating, and appending elements dynamically.  
- **Event Handling:** Used `addEventListener` for clicks, keypress, and dynamic button actions.  
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Trimmed input values and prevented empty task entries.  
- **Toggle Classes:** Applied `.classList.toggle()` for marking tasks as completed.  
- **Editing & Deleting Logic:** Implemented task editing using `prompt()` and deleting via `.remove()`.  
- **Clean UI with CSS:** Practiced designing simple, minimal, and centered layouts with shadows.  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Enabled **Enter key** for faster task entry.  
- **Code Organization:** Learned to break functionality into smaller, reusable functions.
